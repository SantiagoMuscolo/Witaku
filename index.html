                        <span>Anime 「アニメ?」</span>  is the term that identifies cartoons of Japanese origin. Anime is a rapidly expanding medium in Japan,
                        <br>
                        being at the same time a commercial entertainment product, a popular mass cultural phenomenon, and a technological art form.
                        <br>
                        It is potentially aimed at all audiences, from children, adolescents, adults, to classification specializations essentially
                        <br>
                        taken from the existing one for <span>"manga"</span>  (Japanese word to designate comics in general. Outside of Japan, it is used exclusively
                        <br>
                        to refer to Japanese comics.), with base classes designed for socio-demographic specifications such as employees, housewives,
                        <br>
                        students, and so on. Therefore, they can deal with subjects, themes and genres as diverse as love, adventure, science fiction,
                        <br>
                        children's stories, literature, sports, fantasy, eroticism and many others.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Anime is traditionally drawn by hand, but computer animation has become common these days. His scripts include a large part
                            <br>
                            of the fiction genres and are broadcast through cinematographic media (television broadcast, distribution in home video formats and films with audio)
                            <br>
                            . The relationship between Japanese <span>anime</span> and <span>manga</span> is close, as historically a large number of anime series and works are based on popular manga stories.

                        <p>
                            The term anime comes from the abbreviation of the Japanese transcription of the English word "animation" 「アニメーション?」. 
                            <br>
                            Hence it is shortened to "anime". The use of the word "animé" is considered incorrect orthographically, since being a foreign word,
                            <br>
                            it does not have an accent, and if it did it would be in the first letter ("anime").
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Internationally, anime once bore the popular name "Japanimation", but this term has fallen out of use. Fans pronounced the word
                                <br>
                                preferably as an abbreviation for the phrase "Japanese Animation" (Japanese animation in English). It saw its greatest use during
                                <br>
                                the 1970s and 1980s, generally comprising the first and second waves of anime fandom. The term survived until at least the early
                                <br>
                                1990s, but seemed to die out just before the anime revival in the mid-1990s.

                                    In general, the term "Japanimation" now only appears in nostalgic contexts in the Western world, however the term is widely

                                    used in Japan to distinguish animations made there (Japanimation) from animations in general (Anime, in Japan)

                                Among the notable characteristics of the genre, the development of complex plots throughout a certain number of episodes stands out.
                                <br>
                                Much of anime is structured in television series with defined episode numbers dealing with a specific plot that may involve complex

                                In the 1970s, anime begins to take a different direction in the world of animation. Western productions were characterized by
                                <br>
                                being aimed at a child audience, while anime dealt with more complex themes such as existentialism and sometimes used more mature
                                <br>
                                language, some violence and sexual scenes. Several times the target demographics often affect the contexts ideological of the work:
                                <br>
                                for example in the shōnen, in the action series, moments that happen in adolescence are taken as friendship, companionship, fights,
                                <br>
                                adventures, sacrifice for love. In the seinen that is also for a male audience, more mature themes such as political, sexual, or
                                <br>
                                scientific are taken (which, with the exception of kodomo, can also be part of other demographic genres, only they are seen in more depth in this one).
                                <br>
                                It also has to be taken into account that when a manga series is very successful, it is common to adapt it to anime, so it takes elements from it.
